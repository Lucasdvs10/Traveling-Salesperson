# Traveling Salesperson Problem 2.0
## What it is about
### Acording to Wikipedia
The travelling salesperson problem Aka TSP asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

## My previous project
In january 2019 I published on github my first version of TSP made in javascript using Processing js library. Here's a [link](https://github.com/Lucasdvs10/Traveller-Salesperson-Problem) to the repo. In that time I was just starting my studies in computer science and when I read those codes today, I just don't recognize it. So I decided to remake that project applying the knowledge that I acquired in the last 3 years.
